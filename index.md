# Game Build & Test — QA Portfolio (Planned)

This repository will host a **small playable game** that I build and then test end-to-end. The goal is to show awareness of how a game moves from **concept → prototype → playable → release**, and where QA adds value at each stage.

## What will be here
- **Prototype & core loop** (tiny scope, fast iterations)
- **Test plan** (Google Sheets + PDF)
- **Bug reports with short video evidence**
- **Jira board snapshot** (columns & transitions)
- **Post-mortem** (what shipped, risks, lessons)

**Status:** Planned. I’m prioritising the Manual QA portfolio first.
